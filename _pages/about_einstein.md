Engineering has always been more than just a career path for me—it’s a way of thinking, a means to solve problems, and a way to bring ideas to life. From an early age, I found myself fascinated by how things work, constantly taking apart and rebuilding objects just to understand their inner workings. That curiosity evolved into a passion for design, innovation, and problem-solving, leading me to a career where I can apply my skills to real-world challenges.

With experience in both distributed control systems and mechanical design, I thrive at the intersection of precision and creativity. Whether it's designing defense drones or working with complex systems, I find deep satisfaction in turning concepts into tangible, functioning realities. Engineering challenges me to think critically, push boundaries, and continuously learn, which is what makes it so exciting.

Beyond my professional work, I enjoy exploring 3D design and printing, as well as working with robotics. One of my current projects involves integrating my Mitsubishi RV-6SDL-S15 robotic arm with ROS, allowing me to deepen my understanding of automation and control systems. These hands-on experiences reinforce my belief that engineering is not just what I do—it’s who I am. I am driven by the thrill of innovation, the satisfaction of problem-solving, and the endless possibilities that engineering offers to shape the future.
